Once upon a time there was a college student named Billy. Billy had just completed his first year of college and was moving into a house. At first the house seemed great. Everything worked and he liked his roommates. This all changed one Tuesday night.

Billy just decided to start a pancake business and he became a millionaire. His roomates became jealous of him and decided to
open their own business. 

His roomates opened a waffle buisness in the attic so that they could compete with Billy's thriving pancake buisness. They started out doing really well, but the next day, they went upstairs to the attic to find all their waffle making equiptment completely destroyed!
Billy, jealous as he was, was the one who destoried their equipment. His roomates had accused him of doing so, and he admitted that he did. He no longer wanted a rift between his friends so he cut them into his pancake business. They were happy to join and the roomates never argued again.
