Once upon a time there was a college student named Billy. Billy had just completed his first year of college and was moving into a house. At first the house seemed great. Everything worked and he liked his roommates. This all changed one Tuesday night.

Billy just decided to start a pancake business and he became a millionaire. His roomates became jealous of him and decided to
open their own business. 

His roomates opened a waffle buisness in the attic so that they could compete with Billy's thriving pancake buisness. They started out doing really well, but the next day, they went upstairs to the attic to find all their waffle making equiptment completely destroyed!
